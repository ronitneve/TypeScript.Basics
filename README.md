This is a basic guide to typescript language syntax.

## **Variable Declaration**

Declaring Variables using ```let``` keyword
```
let Name = "Banner"
let age = 50
let isGreen = true
```
```let``` Keyword uses *block-scoping*. What that means is variables defined by ```let``` keyword are inaccessable out side of a functional or a conditional block.
